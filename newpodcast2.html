   Hi.<p></p> Thanks for checking out my new podcast interviewing "professional makers", those that make a living through small, independent, manufacturing.<p>
I am excited to have my first guest, Mikey Sklar.<br> If ouy're not familiar with this creative and interesting fellow, then you'll just have to listen in.<p></p>

As you can see (and you'll hear), I don't have a name yet for this series.
And I need your help with that.
You can find a link to an <a href="http://goo.gl/ZCd20Y">online poll</a>, where you can vote for some ideas(or come up with your own), <a href="http://goo.gl/ZCd20Y">here</a>.
Be sure to sign up for the <#id>newsletter</#id> so you can find out the what the name will be, and when the show "offically" launches(did I really need quotes there?).<p></p>
You will get a glimpse into how the sausage is made, as I will rerecord the intro with the name of the show, and record an outro with some call to action to visit the show's new website (it won't be this page).<p></p>
You can also support this show by signing up for <url>Patreon</url>. A service that lets you set your own monthly pledge starting as little as a $1. This money goes straight back into producing the show.<p></p>
If you wnat to skip participating in the poll, consider signing up for the <#id>newsletter<#id> instead. You can also give me feedback on the show, and suggest future guests.<p></p>
I am using the free version of <url>Bandcamp.com</url> to host this episode. For my other podcast, <url>dadverb</url>, I used <url>soundcloud.com</url>, as I could embed URL's into the description. It was ok, but I wanted to try something else. Let me know what you think of it. If youhave a better suggestion for hosting, I'd love to hear about that, too.

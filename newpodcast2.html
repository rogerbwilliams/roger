<div style="width:80%; margin-left:10%"><h4> I love this topic.<br> Its seems so primal and natural to me: make useful things for yourself and others.<br> How you are compensated may have changed, but the spirit has stayed much the same.<br>  Its exciting times in the 21st century. Being able to have better and cheaper tools than ever before, to enable more people to produce physical products.<br> It's so intersting for me to hear the stories of inspiration, failure, and success of these individuals who rely on us, the buyers of these physical goods, for their livelihood. <p></p>
My first guest, Mikey Sklar, tackles these subjects. His electronic-kit business is aligned with his self-suffieciency goals, and enables otheres to do so as well. <br>It didn't start out that way. But since his early days of making "electric clothing", Mikey has learned a thing or two about what it takes to produce and market his kits.</h4><p></p></div>
